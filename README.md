# 🍎 Fruit Quality Classification using InceptionResNetV2

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on classifying **fruit quality (Good / Bad / Mixed)** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on the **InceptionResNetV2** architecture.  
The model distinguishes between different fruit types and their quality levels using processed image data.
